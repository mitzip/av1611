The King James Bible is in the public domain everywhere in the world that recognizes public domain, with one exception, due mostly to it's age.

The notable exception is in the United Kingdom, where it is commonly known as the "Authorized Version". The King James Bible is the only remnant of a time when the British monarchy held a monopoly over all printing and publishing in the UK. 

Although all perpetual copyrights in the UK were abolished by law in 1988, transitional arrangements, which included the King James Bible, do not expire until 2039. Today Cambridge University Press is the Queen's printer and controls the right to print, publish and distribute the King James Bible in the UK.

In 2011 a spokesman for Cambridge University Press stated that generally they do not charge a fee for permission but try to ensure that a reputable source text is used. I have not yet sought such permission.
