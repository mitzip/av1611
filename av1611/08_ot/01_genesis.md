<!-- BEGIN WORD OF GOD -->
IN the beginning God created the Heauen, and the Earth.

 2   And the earth was without forme, and voyd,and darkenesse *was* vpon the face of the deepe: and the Spirit of God mooued vpon the face of the waters.

 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

 4 And God saw the light, that *it was* good: and God diuided the light from the darkenesse.
 
 5 And God called the light, Day, and the darknesse he called Night: and the euening and the morning were the first day.
 
 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters: and let it diuide the waters from the waters.
 
 7 And God made the firmament ; and diuided the waters, which *were* vnder the firmament, from the waters, which *were* aboue the firmament: and it was so.
