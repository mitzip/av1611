### 1611 Authorized Version


**WORK IN PROGRESS**: A plain text type up of the final edition of the public domain 1611 "Authorized Version" King James Bible, all printer errors and old spellings, as is. Artwork included where licensing permits.

As a test I've completed the first few verses of [Genesis](av1611/08_ot/01_genesis.md). I'm still determining the best final edition, before the spellings were modernized, to type from. Additionally, I'm working on the most elegant method to include the side column notes and enable scripted conversion to a crosswire.org module.

**BUT WHY?** Most, if not all, KJV Bibles online are from the late 1700s, or later, with modern spellings. These are great, but to my knowledge there is not a plain text version of the original 1611. This may be because OCR software probably doesn't play well with the antiquated spellings. I enjoy the spellings and also like to compare it to modern editions and study. So really the only way I know how to do this, is type up the original edition.
