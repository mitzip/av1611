### 1611 Authorized Version


**WORK IN PROGRESS**: A plain text type up of the final edition of the public domain 1611 "Authorized Version" King James Bible, all printer errors and old spellings, as is. Artwork included where licensing permits.

As a test I've completed the first few verses of [Genesis](av1611/08_ot/genesis.md). I'm still determining the best final edition, before the spellings were modernized, to type from. Additionally, I'm working on the most elegant method to include the side column notes and enable scripted conversion to a crosswire.org module.
